## OutFoxed

### Background & Overview

Outfoxed will be a top-down, zelda inspired game with a little fox as the playable charater. He'll traverse the screen, taking out chickens, snakes, and dogs. He will have a short-ranged bite attack in front of his current headding. I'd like to encorperate a selth mechanic, where tougher ennimies can be avoided rather than defeated. I would also like to include a power up that gives him a special attack or the ability (fireballs or the ability to go invisible).

### Functionality & MVPs
- User can control the fox with keyboard, moving him around the screen
- Can use space bar to attack in front of him
- Can use the shift key to hide in tall grass
- Eatting a chicken would resotre health
- Would like to have catchy chip-tune music

### Wireframe
The layout of the screen will look something like this.
